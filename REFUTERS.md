# Refuters (R1–R3)

**R1.** `ess-inf(D_min, λ_min) > 0` yet `liminf_t v_obs(t) = 0`.  
**R2.** A *symmetric* Markov coarse-graining increases `Λ_+(u)` strictly.  
**R3.** Renewal (ε>0) holds but linear growth fails without floors vanishing.

Submit as a fork with:
- `reports/*.json` (schema-compliant),
- scripts/notebooks to reproduce,
- brief `methods.md` describing the medium, kernels, and estimators.

No Q&A will be provided here. Forks speak for themselves.
