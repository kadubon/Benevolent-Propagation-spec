# Minimal Test Suite (Pick-any)

- **T1. Heterogeneous KPP in 2D.** Striped / random media; compare measured `v_*` vs `2√(D_min λ_min)`.
- **T2. Contact process on random geometric graphs.** Add ε-refresh; estimate floors from fluctuations.
- **T3. Nuisance-channel test.** Explicit N to measure `L₀` via info-decay.
- **T4. Human–LLM interaction graphs (anonymized).** Infer transport/gain from spontaneous logs; audit-only, no design.
- **T5. Coarse-graining monotonicity.** Apply symmetric Markov coarse-graining; verify `Λ_+(u)` does not increase.

Each test produces one JSON per run, then aggregates in your fork.
